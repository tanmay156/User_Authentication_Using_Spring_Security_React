# User Authentication Using Spring Security React

## üöÄ Project Overview
This is a **full-stack authentication system** built with **React.js** (frontend) and **Spring Boot** (backend). It implements **JWT-based authentication** to ensure secure user login, registration, and access control.

The frontend is styled using **Bootstrap**, handles API requests using **Axios**, and displays notifications using **React Hot Toast**.

## üîß Installation Guide

### **Backend (Spring Boot)**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tanmay156/User_Authentication_Using_Spring_Security_React
   cd backend
   ```
2. Configure the **application.properties** file with your **MySQL database** settings.
3. Build and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   mvn backend:run
   ```
   The backend will now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### **Frontend (React)**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tanmay156/User_Authentication_Using_Spring_Security_React
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Install additional dependencies required for the frontend:
   ```sh
   npm install bootstrap axios react-router-dom react-hot-toast
   ```

4. Run the React application:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### **User Registration**  
- Go to `/register` in the frontend to create a new user by providing a username and password.
- Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the backend.

### **User Login**  
- Go to `/login` to log in with your registered username and password.
- If credentials are valid, you will receive a **JWT token** which is stored in **localStorage** for authentication in subsequent requests.

### **Protected Routes**  
- Once logged in, users can access the **Home Page**, which is a protected route.
- If a valid JWT token is not found or the token is expired, the user will be redirected to the login page.

### **Logout**  
- Clicking the **Logout** button will remove the token from **localStorage**, logging the user out and redirecting them to the login page.
